# Jack
Inteligent room based on RaspberryPi with Arduino

Jack seemed to be my biggest project so far. My main goal was to create my own home assistant controlling sockets, lights, and also most of my previous projects. Its to much to write about, just watch a video (https://youtu.be/JsVWjif12rM) and see my first demonstration model. Everything was in a working stage, but unfortunetally removal stopped project and now it is suspended. However I learned a lot making it.

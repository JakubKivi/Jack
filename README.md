# Jack
Inteligent room based on RaspberryPi with Arduino

Jack is my biggest project so far. My main goal is to create my own home assistant controlling sockets, lights, and also most of my previous projects. Its to much to write about, just watch a video (https://youtu.be/JsVWjif12rM) and see my first demonstration model. Everything is in a working stage, but I am planning to end Jack this summer.

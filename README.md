# Jack
Inteligent room based on RaspberryPi with Arduino

The idea behind the Jack project was to create my own home assistant. I built the first model that could control sockets and lights when logged in. There were also a bunch of sensors and displaysâ€¦ Too much to describe here, just watch the video [Here](https://jakubkivi.github.io/#portfolio-modal-jack).
